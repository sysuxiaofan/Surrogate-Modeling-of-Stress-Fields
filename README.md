# Surrogate-Modeling-of-Stress-Fields
These Python codes are used for surrogate modeling of tectonic stress fields in mineralization dynamics using the deep neural networks method.
1. The Python script that is named "sobol-sensitivity-analysis.py" is used for sensitivity analysis of the stress field.
2. The Python script that is named "latin-hypercube-sampling.py" is used for sampling in the parameter space for numerical simulations to generate the high-fidelity data.
3. The Python script that is named "latin-hypercube-sampling.py" is applied to train a deep neural networks for surrogate modeling tectonic stress fields.
